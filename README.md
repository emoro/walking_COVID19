# walking_COVID19

This repository contains the code and aggregated data to reproduce the figures of Hunter et al. "Effect of COVID-19 response policies on walking behavior in US cities". 

- The script "0_get_census_data.R" gets the census data needed for the analysis through the ACS 2013-2018.
- The scripts "Fig1.R", "Fig3.R" and "FigS9.R" reproduce figures 1 and 3 of the main paper and figure 9 of the Supplementary Material.
- The scripts "Table1.R" and "TableS2.R" reproduce the results of the multivariate analysis for the OLS and Spatial regression models.
- The folder "data" contains the aggregated walking activity by census tract.

If you have questions regarding the code or data, or have questions about the analysis pipeline we used in general, please contact emoro@mit.edu.
